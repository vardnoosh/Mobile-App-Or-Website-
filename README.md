# Mobile-App-Or-Website-
 An Ecommerce company based in New York City sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers can come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
